#Practising Git branching#

1. Create your Git file and repository as normal.
2. In the terminal, type git checkout -b branch_name.

This should create a new branch (the -b branch_name part) and switch you to the new branch. You can check which branch you are on by looking at the terminal - there is a * next to the branch you are on.

3. Make your changes in the code.
4. Go through the usual processes of add . and commit on the branch.
<!-- The master version stops here. -->
<!-- branch_one starts here-->
5. To push to Github, git push origin branch_name
6. Each time you make changes to a branch, go through the usual add, commit, push.
7. Once you are ready to merge... on Github go to compare & pull request. You can then merge the branch with the master.
8. On Github, you can delete the branch.
